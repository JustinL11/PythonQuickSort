>#### ***Purpose***

Code written in Python3 meant to evaluate quicksort functionalities. 

>#### ***Organization***
<br>
quick.py <br>
main.py <br>
numgen.py <br>
input_text.txt <br>
prelim_results.txt <br>
sample1...2...3 .txt <br>
<br>

>#### ***How to use***
<br>

**Quick.py** is our Quicksort algorithm. Users do not have to interact with this file, but it parses through data and sorts the array in accending order. <br>

Calling **numgen.py** allows for user to generate an array of ints within a specified range. User may call - **python3 numgen.py [filename] [quantity] [rangesize]** to generate a file of ints through **Command Prompt** <br>

**main.py** is the main file you want to call to start the program.
Users may call - **python3 main.py [filename]** to get the sorted output within **Command Prompt**
of their data values.

**input_text.txt** is just a sample dataset created using numgen. Feel free to use this file if so desired.

>#### ***Design Notes***

This program currently serves to take a text file from the user through **command prompt**
It parses through and sorts through the file of integers 
outputs the unsorted and sorted arrays to user
